This project is about replicating a machine learning research paper and creating a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch using PyTorch.

*Machine learning paper replicating involves turning a machine learning paper comprised of images/diagrams, math and text into usable code and in this case, usable PyTorch code. Diagram, math equations and text from the [ViT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929).*

Developing ViT, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture.
